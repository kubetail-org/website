# Introduction

## Overview

Kubetail is a logging dashboard for Kubernetes that lets you view multiple log streams simultaneously, in real-time. Using Kubetail you can track requests as they move from one ephemeral container to another across services in a cluster.

The main way to interact with Kubetail is to use the [Kubetail Dashboard](/docs/dashboard) which is available as a webapp that can run on your [desktop](/docs/getting-started/desktop) or in your [cluster](/docs/getting-started/cluster). Once the webapp is running you can get a birds-eye view of your cluster's logging activity and also follow multiple log streams in real-time.

Under the hood, Kubetail uses your cluster's Kubernetes API to retrieve log data and monitor your cluster workloads so your data stays in your possession the entire time. To enable advanced features such as log file sizes and last event timestamps that aren't available in the Kubernetes API, you need to install Kubetail cluster resources in your cluster (see [Advanced Features](/docs/dashboard#advanced-features)). Kubetail's cluster resources are designed from the ground up to be lightweight, secure and to maintain your data privacy.

The Kubetail backend is written in Go and is very resource efficient. A fully-featured Kubetail deployment under a typical workload will use:

| Component     | Memory | CPU    |
| :------------ | ------ | ------ |
| Dashboard     | ~21MB  | ~3.00m |
| Cluster API   | ~21MB  | ~3.00m |
| Cluster Agent | ~13MB  | ~4.00m |
