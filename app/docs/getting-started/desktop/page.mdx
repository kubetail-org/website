```

### Shell

```sh
curl -sS https://www.kubetail.com/install.sh | bash
```

This will download our [install.sh](/install.sh) script and run it in one step. The script will automatically detect your OS/Arch, download the appropriate binary file and place it in your `/usr/local/bin/` directory. To verify that the installation worked you can check the version number:

```sh
kubetail --version
```

### Download Binary

First, download the binary for your OS/Arch (from the latest [release binaries](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest)):

* Darwin ([amd64](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest/download/kubetail-darwin-amd64), [arm64](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest/download/kubetail-darwin-arm64))

Next, rename the file and make it executable:

```sh
mv <filename> kubetail
chmod a+x kubetail
```

To verify that the installation worked you can check the version number:

```sh
./kubetail --version
```
