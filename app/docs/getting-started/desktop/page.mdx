```sh
# Homebrew
brew install kubetail

# Winget
winget install Kubetail.Kubetail

```

By default homebrew will place the executable in a directory that's already in to your path. To verify that the installation worked you can check the version number:

```

### Shell

To install the Kubetail CLI tool (`kubetail`) with a shell script you can run this command:

```sh
curl -sS https://www.kubetail.com/install.sh | bash
```

```sh
kubetail --version
```

### Download Binary

First, download the binary for your OS/Arch (from the latest [release binaries](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest)):

* Darwin ([amd64](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest/download/kubetail-darwin-amd64), [arm64](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest/download/kubetail-darwin-arm64))

Next, rename the file and make it executable:

```sh
mv <filename> kubetail
chmod a+x kubetail
```
