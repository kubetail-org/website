# Cluster

To run Kubetail inside your Kubernetes cluster, you can install the application and its required resources using tools such as Helm, Glasskube, or do it manually with YAML manifests.

## Install

### Helm

To install Kubetail using [helm](https://helm.sh), first add the Kubetail org's chart repository, then install the "kubetail" chart:

```sh
helm repo add kubetail https://kubetail-org.github.io/helm-charts/
helm install kubetail kubetail/kubetail --namespace kubetail-system --create-namespace
```

For more information on how to configure the helm chart see the chart's [values.yaml](https://github.com/kubetail-org/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/kubetail/values.yaml) file. To verify that the installation worked, you can inspect the application's pods:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n kubetail-system
```

### YAML Manifest

For cluster-based authentication use [kubetail-clusterauth.yaml](https://github.com/kubetail-org/helm-charts/releases/latest/download/kubetail-clusterauth.yaml):

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubetail-org/helm-charts/releases/latest/download/kubetail-clusterauth.yaml
```

For token-based authentication use [kubetail-tokenauth.yaml](https://github.com/kubetail-org/helm-charts/releases/latest/download/kubetail-clusterauth.yaml):

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubetail-org/helm-charts/releases/latest/download/kubetail-tokenauth.yaml
```

To verify that the installation worked, you can inspect the application's pods:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n kubetail-system
```

### Glasskube

To install Kubetail using [Glasskube](https://glasskube.dev/), you can select "Kubetail" from the "ClusterPackages" tab in the Glasskube GUI then click "install" or you can run the following command:

```sh
glasskube install kubetail
```

Once Kubetail is installed you can use it by clicking "open" in the Glasskube GUI or by using the `open` command:

```sh
glasskube open kubetail
```

## Access

Once Kubetail is running inside your cluster, you can access it using your usual access methods such as `kubectl proxy` or `kubectl port-forward`:

* **`kubectl proxy`**

  ```sh
  kubectl proxy
  ```

  Visit [http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubetail-system/services/kubetail-dashboard:8080/proxy/](http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubetail-system/services/kubetail-dashboard:8080/proxy/)


* **`kubectl port-forward`**

  ```sh
  kubectl port-forward -n kubetail-system svc/kubetail-dashboard 8080:8080
  ```

  Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To make the Kubetail web dashboard easier to access you can also expose it using a service or an ingress.
