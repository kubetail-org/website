# Cluster

To run Kubetail inside your Kubernetes cluster, you can install the application and its required resources using tools such as Helm, Glasskube, or do it manually with YAML manifests.

## Install

### Helm

To install Kubetail using [helm](https://helm.sh), first add the Kubetail org's chart repository, then install the "kubetail" chart:

```sh
helm repo add kubetail https://kubetail-org.github.io/helm-charts/
helm install kubetail kubetail/kubetail --namespace kubetail-system --create-namespace
```

For more information on how to configure the helm chart see the chart's [values.yaml](https://github.com/kubetail-org/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/kubetail/values.yaml) file. To verify that the installation worked, you can inspect the application's pods:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n kubetail-system
```

Here is an example of the Helm deploy with Traefik ingress, basic authentication and TLS.
It uses namespace "logs" and assumes, that it's already created.
It assumes that there is cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod". You can remove TLS part, if it's not needed.

Use manifest below if you want to create secret and middleware for the basic authentication. You can skip this, if you want unauthenticated access.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: kubetail-auth
  namespace: logs
type: Opaque
data:
  # generate your own by running:
  # htpasswd -nb user1 SecretPassword | base64
  auth: dXNlcjE6JGFwcjEkZzdTSEY0NVUkN1Fsby9JOUFFWXpxYWxkejI2U0wuMQoK
---
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  name: kubetail-auth
  namespace: logs
spec:
  basicAuth:
    secret: kubetail-auth
    removeHeader: true
```

Then use this `values.yaml` for Helm deploy (optionally remove middleware or TLS entries if not needed):

```yaml
kubetail:
  dashboard:
    ingress:
      enabled: true
      name: kubetail
      annotations:
        traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.middlewares: logs-kubetail-auth@kubernetescrd
        cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
      rules:
        - host: logs.example.com
          http:
            paths:
              - path: /
                pathType: Prefix
      tls:
        - hosts:
            - logs.example.com
          secretName: logs.example.com
      className: traefik
```

### YAML Manifest

For cluster-based authentication use [kubetail-clusterauth.yaml](https://github.com/kubetail-org/helm-charts/releases/latest/download/kubetail-clusterauth.yaml):

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubetail-org/helm-charts/releases/latest/download/kubetail-clusterauth.yaml
```

For token-based authentication use [kubetail-tokenauth.yaml](https://github.com/kubetail-org/helm-charts/releases/latest/download/kubetail-clusterauth.yaml):

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubetail-org/helm-charts/releases/latest/download/kubetail-tokenauth.yaml
```

To verify that the installation worked, you can inspect the application's pods:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n kubetail-system
```

### Glasskube

To install Kubetail using [Glasskube](https://glasskube.dev/), you can select "Kubetail" from the "ClusterPackages" tab in the Glasskube GUI then click "install" or you can run the following command:

```sh
glasskube install kubetail
```

Once Kubetail is installed you can use it by clicking "open" in the Glasskube GUI or by using the `open` command:

```sh
glasskube open kubetail
```

## Access

Once Kubetail is running inside your cluster, you can access it using your usual access methods such as `kubectl proxy` or `kubectl port-forward`:

* **`kubectl proxy`**

  ```sh
  kubectl proxy
  ```

  Visit [http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubetail-system/services/kubetail-dashboard:8080/proxy/](http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubetail-system/services/kubetail-dashboard:8080/proxy/)


* **`kubectl port-forward`**

  ```sh
  kubectl port-forward -n kubetail-system svc/kubetail-dashboard 8080:8080
  ```

  Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To make the Kubetail web dashboard easier to access you can also expose it using a service or an ingress.
