# Kubetail Dashboard

The Kubetail Dashboard is a web-based GUI that gives you a birds-eye view of your Kubernetes logs and lets you follow multiple log streams in real-time. You can run the dashboard either locally on your desktop (using the CLI) or in your cluster (as a deployment of the docker image). To install and run the dashboard you can follow the instructions here:

* [Getting Started > Desktop](/docs/getting-started/desktop)
* [Getting Started > Cluster](/docs/getting-started/cluster)

## Core Features

When you open the Dashboard's website the first thing you'll see is a list of all your Kubernetes workloads:

If you click on "status" in the lower-right corner you'll see the health status of the Dashboard's backend server, your cluster's Kubernetes API and also the Kubetail Cluster API (see [Advanced Features](#advanced-features) below):

![health status](/screenshots/server-status.webp)

To view the logs for a particular workload just click on the "view" link next to the workload and the logging console will open in a new tab:

![console](/screenshots/console.webp)

You can also view the logs for a set of workloads by selecting their checkboxes and then clicking on the "Open in Console" button.

## Advanced Features

To enable advanced features like log file sizes and last event timestamps you need to install Kubetail's cluster resources in your cluster. You can do this easily from the Dashboard by clicking on the "Install" button in the Health Status dialog:

After you click on the button, the Kubetail Cluster API status will change to "Pending" and will stay in that state for about a minute until the service is healthy. Then it will switch to "Ok":

And you'll see log file sizes and last event timestamps next to your workloads:
