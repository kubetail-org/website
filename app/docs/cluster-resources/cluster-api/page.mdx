# Kubetail Cluster API

The Kubetail Cluster API is a lightweight server that sits in front of a set of [Kubetail Cluster Agents](/docs/cluster-resources/cluster-agent) and acts as a single entry point for the [Kubetail Dashboard](/docs/dashboard) to communicate with the agents easily.

For installation instructions, see the documenation [here](/docs/cluster-resources#install).
