# Cluster Resources

## Overview

In order to provide advanced functionality that isn't available in the Kubernetes API, Kubetail provides a set of tools that you can run inside your cluster to allow the Dashboard to perform low-level, read-only operations on your log files such as reading their sizes and monitoring them for changes. 

The main tool that Kubetail uses to accomplish this is the [Kubetail Cluster Agent](/docs/cluster-resources/cluster-agent) which is a lightweight executable that runs on each node in your cluster and performs read-only file operations on behalf of the Kubetail application. Sitting in front of the agents is an instance of the [Kubetail Cluster API](/docs/cluster-resources/cluster-api) server which acts as a single entry point for the Dashboard to communicate with the agents easily. A deployment of the Kubetail's cluster resources under a typical workload will use:

| Component     | Memory | CPU    |
| :------------ | ------ | ------ |
| Cluster API   | ~21MB  | ~3.00m |
| Cluster Agent | ~13MB  | ~4.00m |

When you install Kubetail in a [cluster](/docs/getting-started/cluster) the tools are enabled by default but if you're running Kubetail on your [desktop](/docs/getting-started/desktop) you'll have to install them separately.

## Install

To install Kubetail cluster resources using the [Kubetail CLI](/docs/cli), you can use this command:

```sh
kubetail cluster install
```

The CLI tool will use your kubeconfig credentials to connect to your cluster so just switch your default context to install them in a different cluster.

You can also install the cluster resources from the Dashboard GUI see [here](/docs/dashboard#advanced-features).


## Upgrade

To upgrade, you can use these commands:

```sh
kubetail cluster repo update
kubetail cluster upgrade
```

## Uninstall

To uninstall, you can use this command:

```sh
kubetail cluster uninstall
```

## Remove Repo

To remove the Kubetail Helm repository from your system you can use this command:

```sh
kubetail cluster repo remove
```

## Next Steps

Under the hood, Kubetail uses [Helm](https://helm.sh/) to install the Kubetail cluster resources so you can also manage your releases using that tool as well:

```console
$ helm list -n kubetail-system
NAME    	NAMESPACE      	REVISION	UPDATED                             	STATUS  	CHART         	APP VERSION
kubetail	kubetail-system	2       	2025-02-06 10:09:04.849465 +0300 +03	deployed	kubetail-0.9.3	0.9.2      
```
