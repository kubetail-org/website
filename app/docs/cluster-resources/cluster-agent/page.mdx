# Kubetail Cluster Agent

The Kubetail Cluster Agent is a lightweight executable that runs on each node in your cluster and performs read-only file operations on behalf of the Kubetail application. Currently, its operations are limited to reading file sizes, last modified timestamps, and monitoring files for changes.

For installation instructions, see the documenation [here](/docs/cluster-resources#install).
