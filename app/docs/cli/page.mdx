# Kubetail CLI

The Kubetail CLI tool (`kubetail`) acts as an entry point into Kubetail on your desktop. Using the CLI tool you can start/stop the Kubetail Dashboard and perform other Kubetail-related operations on your cluster.

## Install/Upgrade

### Homebrew

To install `kubetail` with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) use this command:

```sh
brew install kubetail
```

By default homebrew will place the executable in a directory that's already in to your path.

To upgrade `kubetail` just upgrade the package through homebrew:

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade
```

### Shell

To install `kubetail` with a shell script you can run this command:

```sh
curl -sS https://www.kubetail.com/install.sh | bash
```

This will download our [install.sh](/install.sh) script and run it in one step. The script will automatically detect your OS/Arch, download the appropriate binary file and place it in your `/usr/local/bin/` directory.

To upgrade `kubetail` just run the command again when a new version is available:

```sh
curl -sS https://www.kubetail.com/install.sh | bash
```

### Download Binary

First, download the binary for your OS/Arch (from the latest [release binaries](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest)):

* [Darwin/amd64](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest/download/kubetail-darwin-amd64)
* [Darwin/arm64](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest/download/kubetail-darwin-arm64)
* [Linux/amd64](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest/download/kubetail-linux-amd64)
* [Linux/arm64](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest/download/kubetail-linux-arm64)
* [Windows/amd64](https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/releases/latest/download/kubetail-windows-amd64)

Next, rename the file and make it executable:

```sh
mv <filename> kubetail
chmod a+x kubetail
```

To upgrade `kubetail` just repeat the steps above when a new version is available.

## Next Steps

To see the top-level commands just run `kubetail`:

```sh
kubetail
```

To start the Kubetail Dashboard use the `serve` sub-command:

```sh
kubetail serve
```

This command will start the dashboard server in your terminal and open [http://localhost:7500/](http://localhost:7500/) in your default browser.

To view your Kubernetes logs use the `logs` sub-command:

```sh
kubetail logs
```

To enable advanced functionality in the dashboard, you can install the Kubetail cluster resources (e.g. Cluster API, Cluster Agent) using this command:

```sh
kubetail cluster install
```
