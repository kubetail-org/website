# `kubetail completion zsh`

```console
Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(kubetail completion zsh)

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	kubetail completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_kubetail"

#### macOS:

	kubetail completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_kubetail

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

Usage:
  kubetail completion zsh [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help              help for zsh
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```
