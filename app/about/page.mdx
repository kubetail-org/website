# About

Kubetail is a logging dashboard for Kubernetes that lets you view multiple log streams simultaneously in real-time. With Kubetail you can track requests as they move from service to service inside your cluster easily. It was designed from the ground-up by developers, for developers to enable you to make logging with Kubernetes fun, easy and private.

We originally started working on Kubetail while we were building cloud-based apps hosted on Kubernetes and got frustrated by how difficult it was to debug apps using `kubectl` and the Kubernetes Dashboard. Although the tools worked well for single long-lived containers they were difficult to use with multiple ephemeral containers. That made us think, how hard can it be to make an easy-to-use, log-focused dashboard for Kubernetes that can handle ephemeral containers natively?

It was definitely harder than we thought but we found that all the software tooling was out there to make the tool we wanted to use ourselves. Using the [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/), [Go](https://go.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/) and an army of other open source tools we built an open-source web dashboard that runs on your desktop or inside your cluster and lets you view your logs without the data ever leaving your possession.

We use Kubetail ourselves so rest assured that we're working as hard as possible to make it the best logging tool for Kubernetes out there. We love feedback ([hello@kubetail.com](mailto:hello@kubetailcom)) so check us out and let us know what you think!

With love,

The Kubetail Team
