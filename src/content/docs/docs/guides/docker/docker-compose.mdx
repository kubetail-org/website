To use the CLI tool locally with `docker-compose` you can use this [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/refs/heads/main/config/examples/docker-compose.yml) config file to get started:

```sh
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubetail-org/kubetail/refs/heads/main/config/examples/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
```

This will mount your local `.kube/config` file into a `kubetail-cli` container and start the dashboard server at [http://localhost:7500](http://localhost:7500).

You can also the the `kubetail-cli` docker image with:

* [Docker Run](/docs/guides/docker/docker-run)
* [Kubernetes Pod](/docs/guides/docker/kubernetes-pod)
