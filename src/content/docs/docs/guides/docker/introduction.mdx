To run the Kubetail CLI tool (`kubetail`) inside a container you can use the [`kubetail-cli`](https://hub.docker.com/r/kubetail/kubetail-cli) docker image. The image is published to Docker Hub and the GitHub Container Registry on every release:

| Registry   | Image                               |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Docker Hub | `kubetail/kubetail-cli`             |
| GHCR       | `ghcr.io/kubetail-org/kubetail-cli` |

Two variants are available:

| Tag suffix | Base image | Description                             |
|------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| _(none)_   | `scratch`  | Minimal image, smallest footprint       |
| `-alpine`  | `alpine`   | Includes a shell and standard utilities |

Running `kubetail` inside docker lets you integrate Kubetail into your local docker development workflows and also allows you to debug your logs from inside your cluster.
