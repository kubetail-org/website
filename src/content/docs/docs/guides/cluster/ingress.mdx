title: Ingress
description: "Expose the Kubetail dashboard outside your cluster using a Kubernetes Ingress. Includes a Traefik example with HTTP Basic auth and TLS via cert-manager."

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

After installing Kubetail in your cluster, the Dashboard is accessible via `kubectl port-forward` or `kubectl proxy` by default. If you want persistent, browser-friendly access without running a local proxy command, you can also expose it using a Kubernetes Ingress resource.

---

## Overview

The Helm chart includes built-in support for creating an Ingress resource for the Dashboard. It's disabled by default but you can use your chart's values to enable and configure it.

The Dashboard service listens on port `8080` inside the cluster. Your Ingress controller needs to route traffic to that port.

---

## Enabling the Ingress

To enable the Ingress, set `kubetail.dashboard.ingress.enabled` to `true` and configure at least one rule:

```yaml
kubetail:
  dashboard:
    ingress:
      enabled: true
      name: kubetail
      annotations:
        traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.middlewares: kubetail-system-kubetail-auth@kubernetescrd
      className: traefik
      rules:
        - host: kubetail.example.com
          http:
            paths:
              - path: /
                pathType: Prefix
```

Then, apply the values to your release:

```sh
helm upgrade kubetail kubetail/kubetail \
  --namespace kubetail-system \
  --values values.yaml
```

---

## TLS termination

To enable HTTPS, add a `tls` block referencing a Secret that contains your certificate:

```yaml
kubetail:
  dashboard:
    ingress:
      enabled: true
      className: nginx
      rules:
        - host: kubetail.example.com
          http:
            paths:
              - path: /
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                    name: kubetail-dashboard
                    port:
                      number: 8080
      tls:
        - hosts:
            - kubetail.example.com
          secretName: kubetail-tls
```

If you are using [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io), you can automate certificate provisioning by adding the appropriate annotation to the Ingress:

```yaml
kubetail:
  dashboard:
    ingress:
      annotations:
        cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
```

<Aside type="tip">
When you serve the Dashboard over HTTPS, set `session.cookie.secure: true` in the Dashboard's `runtimeConfig` so the session cookie is only transmitted over secure connections:

```yaml
kubetail:
  dashboard:
    runtimeConfig:
      session:
        cookie:
          secure: true
```

<Aside>
Only the Dashboard is exposed via Ingress. The Cluster API and Cluster Agent communicate over the cluster-internal network and do not need external exposure.
