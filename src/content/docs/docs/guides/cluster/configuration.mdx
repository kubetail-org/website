description: "Configure Kubetail's cluster components — Dashboard, Cluster API, and Cluster Agent — by overriding runtimeConfig values in the Helm chart."

import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

When Kubetail is deployed in a cluster, each component — the Dashboard, Cluster API, and Cluster Agent — is configured independently using a YAML config file mounted into the container. The Helm chart manages these files for you via ConfigMaps, but you can customize any setting by overriding the chart's `runtimeConfig` fields.

---

## How configuration works

Each component reads its config from a file passed via the `--config` flag at startup:

```sh
dashboard     --config /etc/kubetail/config.yaml
cluster-api   --config /etc/kubetail/config.yaml
cluster-agent --config /etc/kubetail/config.yaml
```

The config file is mounted from a ConfigMap created by the Helm chart. To customize a component's settings, pass your overrides under `kubetail.<component>.runtimeConfig` in your Helm values:

```yaml
kubetail:
  dashboard:
    runtimeConfig:
      logging:
        level: debug
  clusterAPI:
    runtimeConfig:
      logging:
        level: debug
```

<Aside type="tip">
All config files support environment variable expansion using `${VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax, which is useful for injecting secrets at runtime.

## Dashboard

The Dashboard is the web server that hosts the UI and proxies requests from the browser to the cluster. In the cluster environment it runs as a Deployment in the `kubetail-system` namespace.

For the full configuration reference see the [Dashboard reference](/docs/reference/dashboard).

---

## Cluster API

The Cluster API is is the backend server that proxies requests from the Dashboard to the Cluster Agent instances running on each node.  In the cluster it runs as a Deployment in the `kubetail-system` namespace.

For the full configuration reference see the [Cluster API reference](/docs/reference/cluster-api).

---

## Cluster Agent

The Cluster Agent is the small, Rust-based program that runs on each node and reads container log files directly from the node filesystem. In the cluster it runs as a DaemonSet in the `kubetail-system` namespace.

For the full configuration reference see the [Cluster Agent reference](/docs/reference/cluster-agent).
