The `kubetail` CLI tool uses your local **kubeconfig** file to authenticate against your Kubernetes clusters. In-cluster permissions are handled by cluster RBAC.

## Kubeconfig

When you run a `kubetail` command that requires authentication (e.g. `kubetail serve`, `kubetail logs`), Kubetail reads your local kubeconfig file and uses the credentials defined there to connect to each cluster context. All standard kubeconfig credential types are supported:

| Credential type          | kubeconfig field(s)                                         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Client certificate / key | `client-certificate`, `client-key`                          |
| Bearer token             | `token`, `tokenFile`                                        |
| Exec credential plugin   | `exec` (e.g. `aws eks get-token`, `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin`) |
| OIDC / auth-provider     | `auth-provider`                                             |

Kubetail watches the kubeconfig file for changes and picks up new or updated contexts without a restart.

<Aside type="tip">
To use a different kubeconfig file you can:

* Use the `--kubeconfig` CLI flag
* Use the `general.kubeconfig` option in your local settings file
* Use the standard `KUBECONFIG` env variable
</Aside>

## RBAC permissions

`kubtail` uses the permissions of the kubeconfig user. At a minimum, it needs read access to the resources it monitors:

| Resource     | API group | Verbs            |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| cronjobs     | batch     | get, list, watch |
| daemonsets   | apps      | get, list, watch |
| deployments  | apps      | get, list, watch |
| jobs         | batch     | get, list, watch |
| namespaces   | core      | get, list, watch |
| nodes        | core      | get, list, watch |
| pods         | core      | get, list, watch |
| pods/log     | core      | get, list, watch |
| replicasets  | apps      | get, list, watch |
| statefulsets | apps      | get, list, watch |

`kubetail` will automatically detect when a user only has access to a limited set of namespaces.
