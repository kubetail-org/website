By default, Kubetail uses your **Kubernetes API** to watch your workloads and fetch log data. All of the features described here are available in the Kubetail web dashboard without any additional installs.

## Multiple clusters

Kubetail reads your kubeconfig file to discover available clusters and uses the credentials defined there to authenticate against each one. When you have more than one context configured, a cluster picker appears in the top navigation bar so you can switch between them. Kubetail watches the kubeconfig file for changes and refreshes the list automatically, so newly added contexts appear without a restart.

## Workload filters

On the dashboard home page you can see all your workloads in real-time and narrow the view by namespace, workload type and search.

## Real-time tail

Selecting a workload opens the logging console, which starts tailing all of its container logs simultaneously. New log lines stream in as they are written and you can scroll up to see previous lines. You can also use the viewer controls to jump to the beginning of the stream, jump to a specific time or jump to the end to resume tailing.

## Container lifecycle tracking

Kubetail watches Kubernetes pod events in real time. When a new pod or container starts — during a rolling update, a crash-restart, or a scale-out — its logs are added to the active stream automatically. When a pod is deleted its log source is removed from the stream. You do not need to reopen the console or manually refresh to see these changes.

## Log filters

In the logging console you can filter logs by:

- **Container** — show only specific containers by name.
- **Node** — show only containers running on a particular node.
- **Region / Zone** — filter by cloud region or availability zone (sourced from `topology.kubernetes.io/region` and `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` node labels).
- **OS / Arch** — filter by operating system or CPU architecture (sourced from `kubernetes.io/os` and `kubernetes.io/arch` node labels).

Any combination of filters can be applied at once and removing all filters returns the full stream.
